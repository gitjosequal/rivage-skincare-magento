As well as being one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world, the Dead Sea is located at Earth’s lowest point, 410 meters below sea level. The Dead Sea is so-called because its hypersaline waters are inhospitable to marine life.</p></div></div><div class="item"><img src="<?php echo $this->getViewFileUrl('images/slider2-img2.jpg'); ?>" /><div class="text-overlay"><p>In this rare environment we find mineral-rich salt and mud, hypersaline water, reduced solar radiation and a higher concentration of oxygen. For millennia the Dead Sea has attracted people looking for relaxation and optimum well-being. Cleopatra prized the formidable restorative powers of this extraordinary natural spa, while travelers have visited its shores to benefit from the rare 21 minerals that can be found in the water and mud.</p><p>And today the Dead Sea is as popular as ever, drawing visitors from around the world in search of natural healing and rejuvenation.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="fourth-slider the-miraculous" id="our5"><div class="roundimage owl-carousel owl-banner5"><div class="item"><img src="<?php echo $this->getViewFileUrl('images/slider3-img.jpg'); ?>" /><div class="text-overlay"><h3>The Miraculous Dead Sea</h3><p>Since the dawn of civilization the Dead Sea has attracted people seeking relaxation and healing.

One of the few organisms that can survive in the hypersaline water of the Dead Sea is Dunaliella salina, a type of micro-algae which is a rich source of beta-carotene and a powerful anti-ageing element.</p></div></div><div class="item"><img src="<?php echo $this->getViewFileUrl('images/slider3-img5.jpg'); ?>" /><div class="text-overlay"><p>When the salts, the mud and the water of the Dead Sea combine you get a remarkable source of beauty-enhancing, age-delaying and skin-nourishing materials.
